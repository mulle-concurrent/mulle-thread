## Convenience macro for mutex

An easy way to get a locked code region is to use:

``` c
void   foo( mulle_thread_mutex_t *mutex)
{
   mulle_thread_mutex_do( mutex)
   {
      // code block is now executed with mutex locked
   }
   // mutex is unlocked again
}
```

`break` and `continue` will exit the block and unlock the mutex. But when you
use `return` the function exists and the mutex remains locked.
