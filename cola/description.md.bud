# mulle-thread

#### ðŸ”  Cross-platform thread/mutex/tss/atomic operations in C

**mulle-thread** is a set of **C** wrapper headers for a simplified
subset of thread functions and for a limited range of atomic operations that
strongly mimics the thread standard, even if thread is not available. On Windows it
has to do a bit more work.

mulle-threads main advantages are **simplicity**, **portability**, **sanity**.

* basic atomic operations CAS, ++, -- on void pointers.
* basic thread operations
* mutex functionality
* thread local storage, with proper destruction

Since thread has `<stdatomic.h>` and `<threads.h>`, eventually this project
could become superflous. In the meantime though it's a convenient abstraction
on threads and atomic operations.

### Warning

`mulle_thread_once` doesn't guarantee, that exceptions or thread cancellation
within the init function will clear the once flag for a second run. In fact
it will not.
